# Lessonly Coding Style

## `.editorconfig`

The app contains an [`.editorconfig`](https://github.com/lessonly/lessonly/blob/master/.editorconfig) file which specifies most of the syntax conventions (spacing, etc.) we use. Be sure you're using [an Editorconfig plugin](http://editorconfig.org/#download) with your preferred text editor to ensure your code conforms to these conventions.

## General Guidelines

- **Don't ship commented-out code.** It can be a distraction from the actually functional code. If code is obsolete or non-functional, delete it: we'll always have a record of it in Git.
