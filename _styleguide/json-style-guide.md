Unless otherwise noted, these rules apply only to internal JSON endpoints, not necessarily [our public API](https://docs.lessonly.com).

## Use JSON for request bodies.

Rails controllers handle JSON `params` as easily as form data, and JSON is more concise and flexible (especially when handling arrays and objects). Also, our endpoints always return JSON, so itâ€™s more consistent also always to send it.
