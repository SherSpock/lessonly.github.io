This is the style guide page about the style guide. Deep, right?

## Every rule should start with a heading.

This is so that each rule gets a unique URL, since [our style guide theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) adds an `id` attribute to each heading which can be [linked to directly](/meta/#every-rule-should-start-with-a-heading).
